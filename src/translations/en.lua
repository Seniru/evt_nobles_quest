		"My buddy <b><VP>Hootie</VP></b> is the reason I'm still alive.\nI'd die out of starvation if it wasn't him",
		"So you want to know how and why I'm stuck here?",
		"Well long story short, back when I was still <b>young</b> and strong as you,\nI heard about these treasures called <b><VP>spirit orbs</VP></b>",
		"I was a professor too so I was quite interested in researching about this topic.\nI've gathered like a lots of information about them",
		"These orbs are binded to one's soul. Once they are binded with all <b><VP>5 orbs</VP></b> they will be granted the <b><VP>divine power</VP></b>",
		"I'm not sure what kind of power I'd get from those or what would they do to me...\nBut I'm pretty sure the <b><VP>monks</VP></b> know more about how to use it!",
		"But nobody knew where they are exactly located so I came here to find them all by myself.",
		"I think I did a pretty good job finding one <VP><b>shrine orb</b></VP>.\nBut... I choosed the wrong path and was stucked here forever since then.",
		"I'm glad you helped me out! Feel free to talk to me to know anything about these orbs.\nKnowledge is there to share, and you saved me!",
		"Yeah buddy! What do you want to know from me?",
		"Like I said there are <b><VP>5 spirit orbs</VP></b>\n<b><VP>3</VP></b> of them could be found in the <b><VP>shrines</VP></b> in this gloomy forest.\nI'm quite unsure about the rest 2 though...",
		"From the information I have collected, you'll have to face various challenges to get into shrines.",
		"I think you know one already unless you had some magic power to teleport here",
		"Second shrine is guarded by a lot of <b><VP>monsters</VP></b> on it's way.\nSo equip well before exploring there!",

		"I've been holding this evil power for a long time...\nGlad to hear you came to help us",
		"So you're telling you possess all <b><VP>5 spirit orbs</VP></b>",
		"Quite a good job indeed. Now this will make it easier to defeat the evil power forever",
		"These spirit orbs are indeed binded to one's spirit\nOnly couragous individuals can possess all 5",
		"These orbs will help you to <b><VP>divine power</VP></b> which is the only way to destroy the evil\nas far as I know",
		"Once you have activated the divine power and confronted the evil...\nYou will have to travel a long path inside your mind to achieve the <b><VP>divine status</VP></b>",
		"The spirit orbs will help you to find the right path to achieve that. You only have to travel to the way it show you at the right time!",
		"I'm pretty sure you won't succeed it to the most powerful divine energy.\nBut even if you get closer...",
		"It will create a large divine energy which will then summon the <b><VP>goddess</VP></b>",
		"Ancient books say that the beast is too powerful but I'm pretty sure the <b><VP>goddessess' blessing</VP></b> would put it in a weaker state",
		"Which then is our time, to destroy the evil power forever!!!"
